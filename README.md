# Legend-of-the-Ordinary-Slime
 Slime lives in a typical fantasy world where they face other mobs like skeletons, creatures, and even dragons. She used to be just a normal slime, who were considered the lowest of all the mobs. One day when she is just minding her own business wandering the plains, suddenly, THE SWORD THAT SEALS DARKNESS descends out of nowhere. It seems that the hero who wielded the sword has now passed away. The slime has always been a good hearted mob, never killing anyone (not having the ability to do so anyways), and just lives her day peacefully. Now she is destined to wield THE SWORD THAT SEALS DARKNESS and bring good to the evils of her world.
